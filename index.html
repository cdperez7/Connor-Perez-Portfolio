                <div class="content-body">
                    <p>Connor Perez is currently participating in Northwestern's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. He was
                        born and raised in Chicago, and he graduted from Tulane University with a major in Latin
                        American Studies and minors in Business and Spanish. After completing his major and minor requirements,
                        Connor took coding classes for fun during his senior year at Tulane (one of which was taught in
                        Spanish), where he was first introduced to computer science.</p>
                    <p>After graduating, Connor worked in the public health field, most notably for the organization
                        Partners In Health in Boston. At Partners In Health, he worked in donor support and fundraising
                        while taking on additional responsibilities in Dev Ops, involving data management and completion
                        of large data imports and exports. After moving back home, Connor worked on quantitative analysis research for
                        clinical drug trials before deciding to change careers and began the Northwestern program.</p>
                    <p>In his free time, Connor enjoys cooking, eating, travelling, attending Cubs games, and reading
                        fantasy or science fiction novels. He is specifically interested in food chemistry as well. At
                        any point in time, it is likely that there are vegetables and a homemade beer fermenting in his
                        dark kitchen pantry. Connor also loves animals, and he and his fiancée own two cats, Jacque'mo and Forrest.</p>
